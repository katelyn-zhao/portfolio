      </header>
      <p><b>Modal Agnostic Liver Segmentation | </b><i>Python</i></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Improved multiple advanced segmentation models to predict and segment
          the liver from any kind of medical imaging, including various types of
          MRI and CT scans
        </li>
        <li>
          Compared model performance across multiple different architectures
          including U-Net, U-Net++, and ResU-Net++, achieving dice scores of up
          to 0.90
        </li>
        <li>
          Demonstrated the feasibility of using medical imaging volumes for
          liver segmentation, reducing reliance on traditional invasive liver
          biopsies in clinical trials for NASH treatment
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Image Registration for Cancer Treatment Dose Delivery | </b
        ><i>Python, MATLAB</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Performed image registration across multi-phase MRI scans (arterial,
          delayed, portal venous, precontrast) for pre- and post-treatment
          analysis of cancer dose delivery
        </li>
        <li>
          Conducted a comparison of five image registration methods (Rigid,
          Affine, Demons, ANTs, B-Spline) to optimize treatment response
          assessment in hepatocellular carcinoma patients after Transarterial
          Radioembolization
        </li>
        <li>
          Utilized Mutual Information and Entropy Correlation Coefficient to
          develop a global composite score, providing a framework for evaluating
          image registration accuracy across multiple phases, pre- and
          post-treatment
        </li>
      </ul>

          >Machine Learning Differentiation of Liver Disease via Fat
          Distribution MRIs | </b
        ><i>Python</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Investigated the utility of MRI-Proton Density Fat Fraction (PDFF) as
          a non-invasive biomarker for differentiating NAFLD and NASH, reducing
          the reliance on invasive liver biopsy
        </li>
        <li>
          Trained and evaluated Support Vector Machine (SVM) models using
          regional PDFF features from segmented liver regions, achieving an
          accuracy of 0.89 and an F1 score of 0.88 in distinguishing NAFLD from
          NASH
        </li>
        <li>
          Identified Couinaud liver regions 1, 2, 3, and 8 as critical for
          enhancing diagnostic accuracy, with PDFF Interquartile Range (IQR)
          values outperforming median values in ROC-AUC and classification
          metrics
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Liver Segmentation in Medical Imaging | </b><i>Python</i></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implemented multiple advanced segmentation models, specifically
          convolutional neural networks, to predict and segment the liver from
          3D MRIs and CT scans for further analysis of liver characteristics and
          future diagnosis of liver disease
        </li>
        <li>
          Compared model performance across multiple different architectures,
          including U-Net 2D and 3D, U-Net++, Seg-Net, V-Net, and ResU-Net++,
          achieving dice scores of up to 0.96
        </li>
        <li>
          Integrated those models into the first AI driven software for fatty
          liver disease diagnosis named LiverSeg-i, creating a non-invasive MRI
          tool for diagnosing liver disease
        </li>
